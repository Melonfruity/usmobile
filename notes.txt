Should Be True:
1. phone numbers should have a 1 to 1 mapping to customers, meaning phone numbers should not be shared between different customers

Potentially True;
1. customer can have multiple line meaning there can potentially be different billing cycles and data usages for each customer
2. cycle-usage service can potentially involve writing the usage data to the data base

Assumptions:
1. Assume that the usage collection is updated every 15 minutes for the usedInMb field. - This does not mean the cycle-usage service updates the values. The Cycle Usage Service only provides analytics for this.
2. 50 million documents on daily usage means 50 million lines are open since each record is updated only for the usedInMb field
3. JWT extracted from the is trustworthy and is extracted from a session cookie

Things to take note of:
1. Date is updated frequently, and each document for the day is updated accordingly
2. Since I am splitting the user and usage-cycle functionalities between two services, for the session cookie to be valid I would need to take a couple security factors into consideration. One thing I would probably do is share the same domain.

Questions:
How should the billing cycle be handled if a phone number is transfered from user A to B?

Architectural Design & Reasoning
1. Split User and Cycle-Usage
2. Cycle-Usage should be within the same VPC w/ at least TLSv1.2
